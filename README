	Good day to all dear readers of the following README text file!

	In the following lines I will go through the project I have created - TidalApplication.
	I will describe its purpose, its use and the programming features which I have 
used in order to create the following application.

	The following application should serve as a MP3 player to all of its users - kids, 
teenagers, adults and even elderly people! The program should ease its users - it is
expected to show to them their available albums, their playlists, etc.

	The program has 6 main features from which the user can choose. The user is able to
see his current playlist after having chosen an album from which the application gathers
information. The user is able to then add additional songs to or remove songs from his 
PLAYLIST. The user can shuffle the songs in his playlist or choose to see only the next
song in line to be turned on by the MP3. Additionaly, the user can write his current
playlist to his ALBUM or create a new ALBUM and write inside of it. Meaning, the songs
in the text file for that specific album are overwritten according to the current state
of the user's playlist. On the other hand, from the moment the application is started
the used is asked whether he wants to create a new album and add completely new songs
it. His final option is no manually terminate the execution of the application by
pressing a button. 

	During the creation of the program I have been utilizing several types of C# data 
structures - arrays, lists. I have used many classes to spread the production of the 
code and be able to make use of "Inheritance" structures. Furthermore, I have used
methods, condition and loop operators. Lastly, for the shuffling of the songs I have
implemented threads.
